This mods takes into account the level of experience of the player character "Pre Game" so we don't start at level 1.

Also the player can deem his experience goes beyond his level and (cheat) get more perk point when leaving the Vault 111.

By default you have to into the MCM menu to start the process.

If applied at level 1 all S.P.E.C.I.A.L points are reset to 1.

OtherSomething provide variations.
	- AutoSomething starts ThirtySomething without the need to go into the MCM setting. (Level 30 + 0)
	- TenSomething autoStart with Level 10 and 0 extra perk points.
	- FivtySomething AutoStart with Level 50 and 15 extra perk points.
	- MaxSomething AutoStart at level 250.
